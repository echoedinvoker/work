# **_Introducing Product by Jocelyn_**

- **Duration** ~15m
- The use of too many auxliary words like "that" at the beginning will not look very professional.
- Instersion Question by customers.
  - _JoceLyn:_ For the technical part, we will have a technical discussion session later.
- The video part inserted in the middle is a bit redundant.

# **_Reply Question & Discussion_**

- **Duration** ~15m
- _Customer:_ The ingredients for my work order vary from day to day, how does Emily feed the information?
- _Duke:_ ...
  - There are too many "basically" auxiliaries, and they are followed by many assumptions about the default situation before answering the question.
    - And in fact there are multiple solutions, but only one solution is proposed - Excel(It should be a CSV file).
    - What are the solutions?
      - If you only have a single serial number, you can write it in a text file and feed it to Emily.
      - If you have multiple numbers, you can write them as CSV files and feed them in.
      - Alternatively, a user input interface can be added at the front of the robot process for the user to enter the material number.
      - If the source of the material number is fixed, we can also write the process of capturing the material number into the automation process.
- _Custormer:_ ...(Strange question about process execution limit time)
  - No need to explain too much, just say Emily is to perform step by step until all the steps are finished.
    - Other requirements can be customized. (This is important)

- **Duration** ~6m

## **DA Automation**

- Feed data by Excel file.
- Robot is pre-written so that the demo can simply run and add commentary.

## **PDF to Excel data**

- Robot is pre-written.
- It is a pity that there is no emphasis on getting excel data here that can be concatenated with the DA automation such as last demo case.

## **Conclusion**

# **_Last Q&A by Duke_**

- **Duration** ~6m

### **Novatech**

- We(Novatech) will ask our internal staff to collect the more routine tasks and then arrange the time for us to come to the site POC.

### **Rayzher**

- Duke has always emphasized that all key in data should be written in Excel.
  - Not Excel, but CSV, CSV without office operation, some customers will be concerned about this.
  - Even if it is key in data, only the data that will vary needs to be written in CSV.
- Duke has some suggestions for customers:
  - Prepare some dummy data and test environment.
  - Do not have too many columns to fill, because then the time will be stretched too long.
    - The purpose of our trip is to train and see if we can meet your needs in your environment, not to finish a whole project.
    - Even if you want us to train the whole process, it is not possible to be in place at once, it may be divided into many days to test, debug and write.

# **_Final Conclution_**

- Let Duke to answer customer's questions, do not disturb him.
  - Even if he is wrong or has other better solutions.
- Do not use auxiliary words, it will look less professional.
  - Especially Jocelyn.
  - Make sure that every sentence is complete and simple and spoken in a calm voice, that's all.
- Do not circling cursor.
