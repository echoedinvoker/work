## **PTT presentation**

- **Duration**: 10m

### **_Agenda_**

1. **What is RPA?**
2. **Emily's Usage Scenarios**
   - Manufacturing Industry
   - Human Resources
   - Procurement Department
3. **Product Features**
4. **Q&A**

- Ask customers about their needs right at the beginning.

  - Maybe it is too early, should you wait until the end of the PPT presentation and then ask the customer which parts of the presentation are more interesting.

- Still lots of "that", this time there is also "ho".

# **_Dukelo_**

- **Duration**: 8m

- When Duke performs the DA skill, he shows a bunch of codes and says he wrote them, will it scare off people who don't have programming skills?
- Duke explains the DA code directly, including api.sleep, etc., which seems too detailed in my opinion?

  - I think the key point of DA should be how to generate codes in the way of No-Code, and these codes are open to be adjusted directly, which is the unique advantage of Emily.

- Too many I feel, I think...

- The way of explanation is too trivial and does not explain from the perspective of the big picture.

  - To PDF automation for example, Duke focuses on how to convert a single string into data in Low-Code.
  - I think a better way to explain is to start with IO and then directly print out the whole **input** in the console.
  - Finally, our job at Low-Code is to figure out how to get the data we want in this **input**.
    - Emily has helped us simplify the problem first.

- The last DA demo was simply executed and then said that I myself felt that the training was not too difficult.
  - I don't think this approach will be convincing.
  - If you want to make customers feel that DA's training is not difficult, it is most effective to use DA's new trainer and show it to customers directly.

## **Normal Demo**

- Make sure there is a jpg file in the tmp folder before continuing the training loop to send emails.
- Originally, the skill could be run properly, but it got stuck after continuing training to add a loop to send a letter.

  ![alt after](pic/bandicam%202022-09-20%2014-56-09-006.jpg)
  The original #2 runs to #5 after the loop is added, so it is stuck. About #2 how to run to #5 I have no idea.
  - If this bug can be reproduced, it is very suitable for explaining how to debug.

## **Web Crawler**

- The description of Nodes sucks.

  - The part that automatically generates the CSS-selector is not described at all.
    - This is the lazy man's way, selecting nodes[0] will usually select the element that best fits the criteria.
    - Of course, you can also use all the query syntax of JavaScript.

- I didn't do a good job of showing the strengths of JavaScript with regard to data processing.

  - I should be able to find a table from the web randomly, querying correct table, then do method chaining to get the desired data.

- Should be shown to trigger event scenarios.

  - I think the example of the data on modal is quite suitable to be used as a demonstration.

- Should be shown heck data from websocket scenarios.

- The difference between automating with Emily and automating with python.
  - Emily helped us with the IO part.
    - Save a lot of codes, if you want to connect different interfaces, just import is several lines of code.
  - And the change from full code to app has many benefits and, of course, drawbacks, So each RPA product must have its own goals.
    - The goal of UiPath is to make automation available to people who do not know how to write programs at all.
    - Emily's goal is to accelerate the pace of development automation.
