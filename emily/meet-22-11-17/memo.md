- Introduction Process

  1. What is RPA?

     - **Robotic Proccess Automation**
       - Mainly **simulating** people in the **operation unit**, dealing with **epetitive** and **fixed** tasks.
         - When the repetitive and fixed tasks are performed by robots, people **have time** to focus on the tasks that cannot be handled by robots, thus **improving the quality and efficiency of personal work**.

  2. When is it appropriate to use RPA?

     - **Manual operation**
     - **High repetition** rate
     - There is a **rule**

  3. Features of RPA
     - **Imitating human behavior**
     - **Structured reading and processing of data**
       - So before we can use RPA,
         - we need to **clearly define the processing flow**
           - You need to sort out how to arrange the things you normally do so that RPA can be executed more efficiently.
         - **Provide regular data** to RPA for processing
     - **Fast execution**
       - never tired
       - **Focus on the process** and not be interrupted by phone calls, letters, and other things
     - Operate **any application**
       - The behavior of RPA is **non-invasive**,
         - Because it is **simulating human behavior** to operate other different software systems
         - So there is **no need to make any changes** to the IT infrastructure
           - So the **import cost is relatively low**
     - **Zero errors**
     - **24-hour** work
       - So the benefits you get are
         - The data is **100% correct**
         - The **processing duration** can be **accurately predicted** and the work can be **on time at the predicted time point**.
       - So the final result will be
         - Improving supervisor **satisfaction**
         - Improving **the overall operational efficiency** of the company

- What is the difference between RPA and traditional automatic tools (Keystroke Wizard, photoshop record, VBA script, ...)
  - Traditional automation tools are **limited to their own systems**, but RPA not
  - **Process Management**
    - Based on the **different results** obtained at each stage of the process, **different behaviors** are triggered for the next
      - Different results such as the **status of the web page or the status of the data**
