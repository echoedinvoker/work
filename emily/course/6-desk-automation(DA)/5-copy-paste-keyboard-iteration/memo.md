- copy note1 and paste into note2 like above pattern.
- I thought there would be a fade-out and \* symbol problem if I wanted to use the note logo and file name as anchor.
  - But the implementation does not have these problems, the point is to compare the timing of the image and CROP.

- About **api.key collection**
  - Not function, but value.
    - So we cannot call it, it means never add **()** after it.

## **Console.log Summary of all monitoring results**

- This approach can help us clarify whether the error occurred by capturing the wrong image in the first place.
  - This will save a lot of time.
