# **_Double Check every Scanning by Codes/Video_**

## **Why?**

- Many **animation** without careful observation, it is difficult to notice it, like:

  - **buttons rendering**
  - **warning window popup**

- Before the target we need appears, there may be the **same pattern ready to fade out elsewhere**, which can easily lead to misjudgment. _(situation A)_
  - And it is also easy to ignore, the moment before the scan may need to be through the **video recordings** to properly view this phenomenon.

## **How?**

- Watch both the **codes (mainly the scanned commands)** and the **recorded videos**.

### _Codes_

- Note that the observation starts from the instruction line that will **refresh the desired target** for the scan.

### _Video_

- The point in codes will be on **refreshing the target**'s instruction execution and the moment afterwards.
  - You can even **slow down** the speed of the film or **stop** to observe.

## **On the other hand**

- With an in-depth understanding of the state before and after the scan, it is also possible to **remove unnecessary sleep**.

- for examples:
  - In the case of **situation A** above, you can directly use the **restricted range scanning** method instead of using sleep.
  - The target, which has **always existed** on the screen, can also be used without sleep.
  - At the moment, the **system's focus** is already on our target, so you can just use **Enter** to replace the scan.
