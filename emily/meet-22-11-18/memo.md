- I should be able to showcase Emily's app in a short period of time, instead of just showing videos.

  - What to show?

- The presentation could have been better described.

  - Intersperse the questions and use them to lead to the next topic.
    - So the exact process is?
      - Do you know RPA?
      - Do you know some traditional automation program?
        - Very simple to very hard
          - Keystroke Wizard -> Record -> Excel VBA -> Full App
        - Disadvantages
          - Being confined to your own system
          - Interaction with different systems is limited to whether the other party has provided API, if no, it will be very troublesome.
      - Do you have people in your business who use Macbook?
      - Do you have any highly repetitive, rule-based, structured tasks at work?
        - To think about what things are obviously more and more tired of doing is.

- Video loop can be faster and use better player
  - use `mpv --loop-file --speed=2 Document ~/Documents/video odoo1_1.mp4`
